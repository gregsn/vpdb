# VVVV Pack Database for vpm
This is a pack repository for vpm containing .vpack files and .csx scripts. You can add your own by fork-pull-requesting but if you want to push frequently you can request an organization membership in issues or sending me an email with your github username to m@mcro.de.

This repository will be possibly used for a vpm GUI where you might browse packs just like in nuget.

## Folder structure and naming convention
